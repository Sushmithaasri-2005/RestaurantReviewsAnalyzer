# RestaurantReviewsAnalyzer
 This project aims to develop a multi-label classification model that categorises restaurant reviews into multiple aspects such as food, ambiance, service, anecdotes, and price. Additionally, using aspect-based sentiment analysis, the project aims to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each aspect.
